### Transforms
Various transform functions have been collected here over the years to make augmentations easier to use. However, most transforms involving images 
(rather than numpy arrays or tensors) will be deprecated in favor of the [albumentations](https://github.com/albu/albumentations) package
that you can install separately.

### Removed Transforms
